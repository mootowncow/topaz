Trusts:
Trusts missing IsIntimidated logic for JAs and autos? Does intim reset JA recasts?
Trusts get ported to non-owners in party when they do a CS /setPOS. Check that they are the trusts owner on porting(two places)
Move setting last_cast to CTrustController::Cast(uint16 targid, SpellID spellid) incase the spell is para'd (is para check after this?)
Make a list of refresh jobs and only refresh them in CAN_REFRESH gambit_container.cpp logic (a list like std::set<JOBTYPE> melee_jobs in gambits container?)
1: Better NO_MOVE logic, they seem to stay too far to cure because are staying max distance to the enemy but that's not close enoguh to cure? Also should have cast distance set to 19 or something
2: Need to set their distance to stay to the target to be clsoer than the distance to the ally and both shorter than max cast range.
3: Needs to at least allow them to sit 15 yards, atm they sit like 12-14 and its annoying
Elivira needs logic that if she can't see target when trying to RA (!CanSeeTarget()?) 2-3 times in a row she will re-position (like warping if can't auto logic)
